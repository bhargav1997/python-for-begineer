Let's move on to Day 9 of our Python journey, where we'll explore additional topics and examples:

**Day 9: Advanced Python Techniques and Applications**

1. **Network Programming with sockets**: Python provides a socket module for network programming, allowing communication over networks using TCP/IP protocols.

   ```python
   import socket

   # Server
   server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   server_socket.bind(('localhost', 12345))
   server_socket.listen(5)

   while True:
       client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
       print(f"Connection from {address} established.")
       client_socket.sendall(b"Hello, client!")
       client_socket.close()

   # Client
   client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   client_socket.connect(('localhost', 12345))
   data = client_socket.recv(1024)
   print("Received:", data.decode())
   client_socket.close()
   ```

2. **Working with Big Data using Apache Spark**: Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system for big data processing.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

   spark = SparkSession.builder \
       .appName("Example") \
       .getOrCreate()

   df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True)
   df.show()
   ```

3. **Web Scraping with Scrapy**: Scrapy is a powerful web crawling and web scraping framework written in Python.

   ```python
   import scrapy

   class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):
       name = "myspider"
       start_urls = [
           "http://example.com"
       ]

       def parse(self, response):
           for quote in response.css('div.quote'):
               yield {
                   'text': quote.css('span.text::text').get(),
                   'author': quote.css('span small::text').get(),
               }

   ```

4. **Natural Language Processing with NLTK**: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

   ```python
   import nltk
   from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

   nltk.download('punkt')

   text = "This is a sample sentence."
   tokens = word_tokenize(text)
   print(tokens)
   ```

5. **Data Visualization with Plotly**: Plotly is a graphing library for making interactive, publication-quality graphs online.

   ```python
   import plotly.graph_objs as go

   x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   y = [10, 11, 12, 13]

   fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=x, y=y))
   fig.show()
   ```

6. **Deployment with Docker**: Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers.

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY . /app

   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

These advanced techniques and applications will expand your Python skills and prepare you for more challenging projects and tasks.
